Using macOS

Install conda:
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html


Creating an environment
 - check env list:
    >conda env list

- create the env, for instance, with a specific python version (optionally)
 >conda create -n ENV_NAME python=3.8

- check env list again:
    >conda env list

- activate the environment
 >conda activate ENV_NAME

- install jypyter in the ENV_NAME
conda install jupyter

- check whether jupyter has been installed correctly
 >which -a jupyter

- start notebook (in case there are several jupyter installations, use the appropriate one)
/PATH/TO/anaconda3/envs/ENV_NAME/bin/jupyter notebook

This will open the current directory in a browser.

Choose the .ipynb-file to work with.
